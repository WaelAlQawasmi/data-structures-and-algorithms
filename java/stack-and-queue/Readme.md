# Stacks and Queues
Stacks and Queues is a data stracher and in this tast we must use it
to solve this challenge


## Challenge

we have to create 3 class
- Node
- stack
- Queue
 and create methodes to  add ,remove, is Epty, top for Stacke and quess
 and we choude make tests for each of them

## Approach & Efficiency
Big O = n(o)  for time and space
## API
###Stack methods 
- isEmpty: to cheack if empty (true / false)
- push :to add node to stake
- pop: to remove node from stack
- peek: to retern the top Node value

###  Queues
Stack methods
- isEmpty: to cheack if empty (true / false)
- enqueue :to add node to Queues
- dequeue: to remove node from Queues
- peek: to retern the top Node value
