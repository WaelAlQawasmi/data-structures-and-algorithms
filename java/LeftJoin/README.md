# Hashmap LEFT JOIN


## Challenge
function that LEFT JOINs two hashmaps into a single data structure take Arguments two hash maps
The first parameter is a hashmap that has word strings as keys, and a synonym of the key as values.
The second parameter is a hashmap that has word strings as keys, and antonyms of the key as values.
Return: The returned data structure that holds the results is up to you. It doesnâ€™t need to exactly match the output below, so long as it achieves the LEFT JOIN logic

## Approach & Efficiency
> Big O

- time O(n).
- space O(n).
