## Approach & Efficiency
i used the linked list data structuer , deuto the challenge based on it Big O  time compixity => O(n)
and Big O  space compixity => O(1)

## Solution
vt adding node  in linked list2 after each Node of linked list 1 respectively 
using methode to add in midle and methode tp add in the end
